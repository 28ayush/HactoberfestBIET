// This is a JavaScript function called "calculateArea" that calculates the area of a rectangle.
// It takes two parameters: "length" (length of the rectangle) and "width" (width of the rectangle).
function calculateArea(length, width) {
  // Check if either "length" or "width" is less than or equal to zero.
  if (length <= 0 || width <= 0) {
    // If either dimension is invalid, return an error message.
    return "Invalid dimensions. Length and width must be greater than zero.";
  } else {
    // If both dimensions are valid, calculate the area by multiplying length and width.
    const area = length * width;
    // Return the calculated area.
    return area;
  }
}

// Example usage of the function:
const length = 5;
const width = 3;
const area = calculateArea(length, width);

// Output the result to the console.
console.log(`The area of a rectangle with length ${length} and width ${width} is ${area}.`);
